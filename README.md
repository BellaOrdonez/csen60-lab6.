Whatâ€™s the difference between how your website is rendered in Lab 4 vs. Lab 6?
The difference is that the website in lab 4 is run through a local platform using a copied path from VS Code whereas in lab 6 we are running the website through a server which is run globally through the internet. The website is performing a request and response from the server.
